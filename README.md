# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project explores and builds a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a person is likely to be diabetic based on medical and demographic features.

## 📌 Project Overview

Early prediction of diabetes can help individuals take preventive measures. This project uses a public dataset and applies data preprocessing, visualization, and several ML models to create a reliable prediction system.

## 🧾 Dataset


- Features include: `gender`, `age`, `smoking_history`, `bmi`, `HbA1c_level`, `blood_glucose_level`, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

## 🧪 ML Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)


All models were evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
